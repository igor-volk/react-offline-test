I used d3 to create the graphics

I have changed dependencies to add hot reloading with TypeScript. Otherwise the key commands to run the project stay the same:

1) npm i
2) npm run start
3) npm run test

I made d3 UI components reusabe by adapting the data returned by the Energy Mix service to a common type with `name` and `value` fields
replacing `fuel` and `perc`.
